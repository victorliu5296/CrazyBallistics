# Crazy Ballistics: Nonstandard Ballistics
## Description
This is a solver for non-standard physics in ballistics, in the sense that it is a controlled environment in which there is no air resistance and there are any amount of time derivatives of position. This means that acceleration can be set non-constant!

This work is mainly inspired by b2studio's video [Cannons that Never Miss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKd32I0uwAQ).
