     * To calculate this bound by hand, start from the highest degree negative coefficient,
     * then check all higher degree coefficients from high to low for positive terms, scaling a power of 2 incrementally each time the positive coefficient is used.
     * After computing the radicand, you take the root of the difference of degree (j-i).
     * Highest degree negative coefficient: -6 from -6x^2
     * Pair with 1 from 1x^3, t_3 = 1
     * Compute (-2^1 * -6 / 1)^(1/(3-2)) = 12
     * It is the only radical so Min({12}) = 12
     * Then consider -6
     * Pair with 1 from x^3, t_3 = 2 (second time being used)
     * Compute (-2^2 * -6 / 1)^(1/(3-0)) = 2.88449914
     * Pair with 11 from 11x^1, t_1 = 1
     * Compute (-2^1 * -6 / 11)^(1/(1-0)) = 1.09090909
     * Take the minimum Min(2.88449914, 1.09090909) = 1.09090909
     * 
     * After computing all minimums, take the max of all minimums
     * Max({minRadicals}) = Max(12, 1.09090909) = 12
     * So the computed upper bound is 12

     * max(0.66666666, 1.74716093) = 1.74716093
