Here is explanation of a basic algorithm for finding all the positive real roots of a polynomial. It is far from optimized but it works.

There exists a theorem called [Sturm's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturm%27s_theorem), which states allows you to count the number of real roots of a squarefree polynomial inside an open-closed interval $]a,b]$. 

## Polynomial real root-finding algorithm
A recursive formulation of a basic algorithm for finding all positive real roots of a polynomial (can be applied to any interval on the real number line).

### Plain text formulation
- Initialize the bound on the roots. This creates an initial interval with all the roots contained inside.
- Execute the bisection algorithm: divide the interval in half. This gives us 2 new intervals. Then, apply Sturm's theorem to find the number of the roots in the interval.
  - If there are no roots in the interval, we discard it as it is not useful anymore.
  - If there is 1 root, we apply the root-bracketing algorithm to isolate the root to a desired precision.
  - If there is more than 1 root, then we pass it back into the algorithm to be bisected.

### Mathematical formulation
- The input of the algorithm is a polynomial function $f(x)$ of degree $n$, and an initial interval $[a, b]$ that contains all the real roots of $f(x)$. The output is a list of real roots of $f(x)$, isolated to a desired precision $\epsilon > 0$.
- The algorithm initializes an empty list of roots $R$, and a stack of intervals $S$ that contains the initial interval $[a, b]$. Then, it repeats the following steps until $S$ is empty:
  - Pop an interval $[c, d]$ from $S$.
  - Apply Sturm's theorem to find the number of real roots of $f(x)$ in $[c, d]$, denoted by $k$.
  - If $k = 0$, do nothing.
  - If $k = 1$, apply the root-bracketing algorithm (such as bisection, secant, or Newton's method) to isolate the root of $f(x)$ in $[c, d]$ to within $\epsilon$, denoted by $r$. Append $r$ to $R$.
  - If $k > 1$, bisect the interval $[c, d]$ into two subintervals $[c, m]$ and $[m, d]$, where $m = (c + d) / 2$. Push $[c, m]$ and $[m, d]$ to $S$.
- Return the list of roots $R$.

### Pseudo-code
```
function find_roots(f, a, b, tol):
  # f is the polynomial function
  # a and b are the lower and upper bounds of the initial interval
  # tol is the desired precision for the roots
  # returns a list of roots

  # initialize an empty list of roots
  roots = []

  # initialize a stack of intervals to process
  stack = [(a, b)]

  # loop until the stack is empty
  while stack is not empty:
    # pop an interval from the stack
    (c, d) = stack.pop()

    # apply Sturm's theorem to find the number of roots in the interval
    n = sturm(f, c, d)

    # if there are no roots, do nothing
    if n == 0:
      continue

    # if there is one root, apply the root-bracketing algorithm to isolate it
    if n == 1:
      root = bracket(f, c, d, tol)
      # append the root to the list of roots
      roots.append(root)

    # if there is more than one root, bisect the interval and push the subintervals to the stack
    if n > 1:
      m = (c + d) / 2
      stack.push((c, m))
      stack.push((m, d))

  # return the list of roots
  return roots
